### How to Run Locally ‚ùî

To run the Seat Reservation System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the code repository.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred terminal or code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the required npm packages by running the following command in both the `client` and `server` directories:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   - Navigate to the `backend` directory using the terminal.
   - Create a file called `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following keys with the correct details:

     MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_url
     PORT=chosen_port_number
     ```

   - Run the following command to start the server:
